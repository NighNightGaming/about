ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE
====================

Nigh Night Gaming Collective (NNGC) is an open group of 
developers and artists of varying skills focusing on 
original, interesting, and, most importantly, fun game development.

NNGC is dedicated to openness and readibility. As a group 
we want to go beyond poorly written game development tutorials 
by learning through practice and working together. We promote communication 
and commitment as the cornerstones of good development practices and want 
to develop a group of developers and game designers who agree.

We are not the most talented programmers or designers, 
nor are the majority of us full time game makers, 
but here at Nigh Night Gaming Collective, 
what we love comes to life and becomes interactive.

 

NNGC was founded by Michael Pérez in 2013.


OUR MANIFESTO
============

We are mostly composed of learning developers 
(what ever that may mean for you)
learning as we stumble along our way through out to-do list.
To make it easier working together, we created a manifesto:

	1. Make code readable:
		One liners are nice, elegant, and effective, 
		but are not useful to anyone trying to learn 
		anything as they are often esoteric and cramped, avoid them.
	2. Comment everything
		No one thinks like you, so let us pick your brain a little. 
		How else are we supposed to know why or how 
		you implemented that very intricate algorithm or structure?
	3. Don’t touch mom!
		The way we are organized currently enables everyone 
		to do whatever they want with their own copy of the source code, 
		but not to touch the mother source until the changes are approved by the community.
	4. Keep us in the loop
		You may be a genius, but if two people are working 
		on the same project without working on it together, 
		it is a waste of time and effort. Update the ‘whatsworking’ 
		with what your doing so that we know whats going down. 
		Projects are mostly first come, first serve, but that’s not fixed. 
		The Change-log also needs updates, but only when changes are implemented in the mother.
	5. Stay on track
		While we want to support creativity and individual thinking, 
		we are a collective and would be rendered 
		useless if everyone would be working on their own projects. 
		For the creative we created a ‘Big Idea’ doc 
		which’ll allow you to talk about what you want to do 
		and have it considered for the next project.
	6. Have fun
		We had to have the corny, bullshit element, but its also honest. 
		We want to have fun, this is not a job, we are not getting paid, 
		we are learning though projects that excite us. 

		If the project doesn't excite, then whats the point?
